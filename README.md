Covid-19 became a threat to humanity.  Social distancing is one of the primary solution to mitigate the spread of the virus. With this, the researchers create a hardware solution that solves the noncompliance of individuals in the social and physical distancing measures and to incorporate a software  that can record individuals who came in close contact with each other to assist in the mitigation of the spreading of the Covid-19 virus.

Specifically, the study targets to attain the following objectives:
Develop a device using ESP32 microcontroller that will incorporate its built-in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) feature as a means of detecting other ESP32 BLE enabled devices.
Integrate a buzzer into the device that will activate whenever 1-meter physical distancing is violated and set a 10 second duration before the device logs the personal information of the other scanned devices.
Develop a system (Recede) that can interact with the device to store and provide real-time reports for users' contact tracing logs.
Evaluate the systems' quality and reliability using ISO 25010:2011 System and Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation Criteria.

Each one of the objectives are successfully implemented.
